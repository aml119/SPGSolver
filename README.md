SPGSolver
=========

SPGSolver is an application framework written in Scala for solving Parity Games. The framework supports "Random Games", "Jurdzinski Games", "Clique Games", "Ladder Games" and "Model Checker Ladder Games" generated with PGSolver.

> A parity game is played on a colored directed graph, where each node has been colored by a priority â€“ one of (usually) finitely many natural numbers. Two players, 0 and 1, move a (single, shared) token along the edges of the graph. The owner of the node that the token falls on, selects the successor node, resulting in a (possibly infinite) path, called the play. The winner of a finite play is the player whose opponent is unable to move. The winner of an infinite play is determined by the priorities appearing in the play. Typically, player 0 wins an infinite play if the largest priority that occurs infinitely often in the play is even. Player 1 wins otherwise. This explains the word "parity" in the title.

###### Example

A parity game. Circular nodes belong to player 0, rectangular nodes belong to player 1. 
On the left side is the winning region of player 0, on the right side is the winning region of player 1.
